In this little project I experimented with Compound Components.

By playing around with compound components it became obvious to me that this is the perfect way to create a personal library of UI components to use across many projects websites/apps. Similar to how Google use material design to give each of their websites a Google-like feel to them.

I look forward to using compound compnonets to add a personal signature across all the projects I create.
